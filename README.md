# layout-optimization-research
This is the research project we started as a way to evaluate the efficiency of some initial layout designs we considered. 
The project was of great help in the proces of deciding which layouts designs should be implemented.

The project contains the code used to generate the adaptive layout and various methods used to compare layout efficiency.
